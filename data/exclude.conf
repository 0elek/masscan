#Stop scanning and probing our network, 153.11.0.0/16.  We are a defense 
#contractor and report to Federal law enforcement authorities when scans 
#and probes are directed at our network.  I assume you don't want to be 
#part of that report.   Please permanently  remove our network range from 
#your current and future research.

#Thank you
